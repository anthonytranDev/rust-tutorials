## std::mem::size_of

## tuples
Collection of different types. Each value in tuple has a type signature `(T1, T2, ...)`. Where `T1` and `T2` are its members

## array
An array is a collection of all the same type `T`, stored in contiguous memory. There length is known at compile time.

There type signature is `[T; length]`

### contigious (English)
